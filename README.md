# Space-Station-Tracker

Welcome to the ISS Tracker Twitter Bot project! This Python-based Twitter bot fetches the current position of the International Space Station (ISS), plots it on a map, gathers crew information, and tweets updates every 5 minutes.


The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite, that orbits Earth at an average altitude of approximately 420 kilometers (261 miles).

ISS Speed
The ISS travels at an average speed of about 28,000 kilometers per hour (17,500 miles per hour).
